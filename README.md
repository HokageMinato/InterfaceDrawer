# Inspector Interface Injector
Easily Inject interface instances from inspector with type validation and drag and drop functionality.

Limitations:

● Collections are not supported, yet.
  However you can make collections of InterfaceHolder 
  For eg: InterfaceHolder[] or List<InterfaceHolder<T>>

● Object Picker show null.
  Might fix later, might not

● Accessing interface requires accessing wrappers.
